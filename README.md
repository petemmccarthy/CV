I'm a Junior Developer based in London. After graduating in Economics I spent 10 years in Banking before joining [Makers Academy], a highly selective, 12 week Software and Web development course. 

I made this decision as Software and Web development couples together areas I'm passionate about – technology, solving problems and being creative.

As well as Object Oriented Programming, Software design and Full-Stack Web development, the course focussed on developing best practices such as Behaviour/Test Driven Development, Pair Programming and Agile principles. 

I also learnt how Software and Web applications should be designed and built in collaboration with the client or with the end user in mind and with bug free, easily maintainable code.
