After graduating in Economics I spent 10 years in Banking before joining [Makers Academy], a highly selective, 12 week Software and Web development course. 

I made this decision as Software and Web development combines areas I'm passionate about – technology, solving problems and being creative.

As well as Object Oriented Programming, Software design and Full-stack Web development, the course focussed on developing best practices such as Behaviour/Test Driven Development, Pair Programming and Agile methodologies. 

I also learnt how Software and Web applications should be designed in collaboration with your client and from the end users perspective, with easily maintainable code.

Some recent code samples are below:-
